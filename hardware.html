        <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Overview:</span> Here we will be diving into the question, &quotWhat is a computer actually made of?&quot Think about it, we have them in our house, in our pockets, running our cars, flying our planes, but even though these are all different jobs all computers are built the same way. They all have motherboards, they all have CPUs, they all have RAM, but what the heck do these letters mean? Good question young padawan(sorry, Im a nerd). The answers to this question will be revealed for the following elements.</p>
            <ul><span style="float: left; margin:0 5% 0 0">
                <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Mother Board</span></li>
                <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">CPU</span></li>
                <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">RAM</span></li>
        </span></ul>
        <ul><span style="float: right; padding:0 0 0 -4%">        
                <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">PSU</span></li>
                <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">GPU</span></li>

<p class=pleft><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Mother Board:</span> When referring to the motherboard I like to ask myself, &quotWhy is this called a motherboard.&quot Well think about what your mom means to you. For me, my mom is the structure of my family, everyone can connect to her and by doing so our family works in unity. Well, computer nerds have mothers too(in fact most live with them). This being said we can see how this piece of the computer earned its name; the motherboard is the structure of the computer, all the other components are placed into it. But all it is, is a very fancy circuit board. It has transistors, it has resistors, but it is designed so that certain pieces like the CPU and RAM can fit into it. There are 2 main types of motherboards, the most common that you probably have in your PC is a ATX Motherboard. An ATX motherboard compared to the other three is only different in the design(its newer; more features, faster, bigger) and like all pieces of computers, it will eventually be replaced, like the other three, by something faster, bigger, and most importantly &quotnewer.&quot
